I assumed multiple ari reports from consecutive weeks are one ari event. There is one row in the table per ari event which may span multiple survey weeks.

consecutive_ari_group is an identifier for each (pid, year) that distinguishes between different ari events for that (pid, year).

week_span is how many survey weeks the ari event lasted. If someone reports an ari in week 10 and week 11 but not in 12 then week_span is 2. If someone reports an ari in week 40 and not in week 41 then week_span is 1.

first_week_from_start is the survey week index where the ari for that ari event was first reported. Week 0 is the first survey week of 2020 and this counter does not reset between years (so continuity across years is easier to see).

last_week_from_start is like first_week_from_start but it's the last week the ari for that ari event was reported. If they are the same then ari was only reported in that week (next week's survey did not show an air).

The way duration (total_known_symptom_duration) is calculated is

earliest_weekly_duration (from the first weekly survey for the ari event) +

(week_span - 1) * 7 (if the ari event lasted for multiple weeks then count all the days between the first and the last week) +

last_daily_duration (how many daily surveys in the last week of the ari event show symptoms)

earliest_weekly_known_duration is like earliest_weekly_duration but mising values are replaced with 1 (I assume that the ari lasts for at least 1 day)

last_daily_known_duration is like last_daily_duration but missing values are replaced with 0

ari_start is the monday of the week that the first weekly survey of the ari event was asking about (i.e. it's the monday before that survey was sent out)

swab_date is the earliest swab date available for that pid for that year that is not earlier than ari_start.

swab_result is all the results available for the swab.
